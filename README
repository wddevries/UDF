INSTALLATION:

1. Apply 'driver_current.patch' to your source tree and rebuild your kernel.  
This will make three changes: 
 * an ioctl will be added to the scsi_cd driver, which is used to read session 
   information from the disc, 
 * mount_udf2 will be added to the list of external mount programs in the 
   mount(8) command, 
 * and the file 'sys/sys/udfio.h' will be created.  
Unless you also run "installworld", you will need to copy 'sys/sys/udfio.h' to 
'/usr/include/sys/udfio.h', and rebuild and reinstall the "mount" command 
(in sbin/mount).  The file system will work without the ioctl, but 
functionality will be decreased.

2. Build and install UDF2 file system by running "make && make install" in the
project's source directory.  This will install the following four files:
'udf2.ko', 'udf2_iconv.ko', 'mount_udf2', and 'mount_udf2.8.gz'.

REMAINING WORK ITEMS:
 * Extensive testing
